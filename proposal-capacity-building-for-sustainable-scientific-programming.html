              <h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Many workgroups complain about a lacking culture of code-sharing and
code-reuse. This leads to inefficiencies in the workflow of scientific
production. An initiative is proposed that a) provides pieces of
immediately useful code of a quality suited for sharing and to be used
in b), i.e. associated teaching activities to develop scientific
programming skills and know-how to foster a culture of scientific
programming that produces high-quality code, embraces code-reuse, and
is aware of state-of-the art development tools and&nbsp;practices.</p>
<h2>Problem&nbsp;statement</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Many groups observe that PhD students and Postdocs are constantly
    “re-inventing” the wheel.</strong> In any group there are standard tasks
    that should be solved in a sufficiently generic way, implemented
    cleanly and and documented sufficiently verbose, so that dealing
    with that specific task does not involve writing a new program in
    the future. This in general does not happen, which leads to a
    reduced efficiency in producing research&nbsp;output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Standardized plots and diagnostics can help to interpret results
    across different model runs, researchers, workgroups.</strong> Often the
    choice of the color scale alone, not to mention possible
    transformations of values or axes (projections) make the comparison
    of different plots and their interpretation unnecessarily&nbsp;difficult.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>What does not&nbsp;work</h2>
<p>The development of a software package that solves all problems once
and for all is tempting, frequently attempted, and always fails. In
fact, a great many software packages for the tasks mentioned above
already exist. Their application however remains fragmented, sometimes
because researchers are not aware of the existence of the particular
package they need, but frequently because the
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000007.html">&#8220;Not-Invented-Here&#8221; Syndrome</a>
is (for good reasons) a strong force in research&nbsp;environments.</p>
<p>One reason that the monolithic approach does not work is the need of
researchers to understand exactly what they are doing, and that they
often have the desire to determine a software’s operation to the
smallest&nbsp;detail.</p>
<p>Therefore any pre-canned “black-box”<sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> approach reaches its limit
quickly, and researchers resort to implementing the algorithm
themselves from scratch. The result is an ad-hoc piece of code,
undocumented, opaque to everybody else, non-reusable, written in
whatever language the researcher is most comfortable with, and
frequently containing bugs that cost time later in the&nbsp;project.</p>
<h2>Our&nbsp;approach</h2>
<p>The hypothesis of this proposal is that the solution to the problem
does not lie in writing just the right software, but in influencing
workgroup research culture and practices and in promoting the
development of relevant individual state-of-the art programming&nbsp;skills.</p>
<p>There are workgroups that have such a culture. From anecdotal evidence
it seems that this always involves a person with the dedicated job to
maintain an archive/software repository and curate the group’s
software output (e.g. <em>dyntools</em> in the Atmospheric Dynamics
group). There was a strong consensus across many <span class="caps">C2SM</span>-workgroups at a
recent meeting, that a structural changes in hiring-policy are
required for sustainable improvements of the scientific code <span class="amp">&amp;</span> data
situation. Until then, however, <span class="caps">C2SM</span> could play a similar (yet clearly
limited) role for groups that do not have the necessary&nbsp;resources.</p>
<p>The focus of the proposed project lies on anchoring a culture of
software re-use in the respective workgroups, on enabling the
development of relevant programming skills through a <strong>tutorial</strong>,
<strong>workshops</strong>, and relevant <strong>example code</strong>.  <strong>The “example code”
plays a key role</strong>, as it should serve, next to being a teaching
device, <strong>as an immediately applicable program that responds to
specific re-occurring tasks in the respective workgroup</strong>. It is
different from &#8220;pre-canned&#8221; solutions, in that it is very well
written, extremely well documented, and interlinked with other
programming&nbsp;resources.</p>
<p>The tutorial will, for example, cover a simple modification to the
example script, inclusive its submission to a version control&nbsp;system.</p>
<p>The overall aim is to supply a useful piece of software to lure
(mostly beginning) researchers into building their individual code on
tried and tested foundations, instead of re-inventing the wheel, and
ideally to do so in a way that lets others profit from their&nbsp;work.</p>
<p>The project would use Python and R as main languages, which doesn’t
prevent the inclusion of <span class="caps">CDO</span>, <span class="caps">NCO</span>, bash, or other external tools if
necessary. In particular, exploring toolchain options ranging from
NetCDF focussed command-line tools in the climate modelling community
to <span class="caps">GIS</span> tools, such as <span class="caps">QGIS</span>, used by many impact modelling groups,
could have the potential to boost the technical know-how&nbsp;available.</p>
<h2>Requirement</h2>
<p>A sufficient large number of <span class="caps">C2SM</span>-groups (min. 4?) that actively
collaborate, i.e. contribute (wo)man-power towards the specification
of the example code, coding, testing, documenting,&nbsp;&#8230;</p>
<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Code that solves specific problems</strong> (non exhaustive!) for each
    participating workgroup “out-of-the-box”, yet is well written and
    documented in a way that makes it an attractive starting point for
    own&nbsp;developments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A tutorial</strong> that uses these examples to teach basic techniques
    and enable and motivate researchers to expand the stock of useful&nbsp;example-scripts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A software <strong>repository</strong> that holds code and documentation, can be
    accessed “reading and writing” by <span class="caps">C2SM</span> attached researchers and is
    maintained by <span class="caps">C2SM</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <span class="caps">C2SM</span> run <strong>course/workshop</strong> based on the&nbsp;tutorial.</p>
</li>

<p>”Black-box” here refers also to code that is available, e.g.
<a href="https://wiki.c2sm.ethz.ch/Wiki/VisNCLCosmoLibrary">cosmolib</a>, but
is too costly to understand well enough to have confidence that it
